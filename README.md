# Elpod

An enterprise-friendly structure for Elysia applications: explicit constructor DI, feature boundaries, and native Elysia routes in controllers.

> Working alpha. APIs and conventions may change. Elpod is a foundation for application structure, not a production-readiness or security guarantee.

## Why Elpod?

Elpod is for teams building a medium-to-large Bun/Elysia service who want named feature boundaries, visible dependency graphs, and useful operational checks without replacing Elysia. It is not a database, identity provider, message broker, deployment platform, or drop-in NestJS migration.

| Approach | Strength | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plain Elysia | Small, direct, native API | Your team owns conventions as the codebase grows |
| Elpod | Explicit DI, pods, lifecycle boundaries, native routes, `elpod audit` | Working alpha; adapters and deployment policy remain application-owned |
| NestJS | Mature batteries-included application conventions | Decorators and framework abstractions are a poor fit for teams choosing native Elysia/Bun |
| Hand-rolled structure | Total freedom | Boundaries, testing conventions, and architecture checks must be designed and maintained by each team |

## Quickstart

```bash
bun create elpod my-app
cd my-app
bun run dev
```

`bun create elpod` creates the starter structure and installs both `@elpod/core` and `@elpod/cli`. See [Getting started](./docs/getting-started.md) for the longer path.

## A minimal feature

Controllers use the native Elysia instance. Pods wire the controller and its providers. Services contain application logic.

```ts
// src/features/hello/hello.service.ts
export class HelloService {
  greet() { return { line: "the service is alive" }; }
}
```

```ts
// src/features/hello/hello.controller.ts
import type { ElpodElysia } from "@elpod/core";
import { HelloService } from "./hello.service";

export class HelloController {
  static readonly inject = [HelloService] as const;
  constructor(private readonly hello: HelloService) {}

  routes(app: ElpodElysia) {
    return app.get("/", () => this.hello.greet());
  }
}
```

```ts
// src/features/hello/hello.pod.ts
import { pod } from "@elpod/core";
import { HelloController } from "./hello.controller";
import { HelloService } from "./hello.service";

export const hello = pod({
  name: "hello", prefix: "/hello", controller: HelloController,
  providers: [HelloService],
});
```

`GET /hello` returns:

```json
{"line":"the service is alive"}
```

## What makes it different

- No decorators, reflection, service locator, or parallel router.
- Constructor injection and provider lifetimes are explicit and type-checked.
- Routes stay native Elysia routes, so Eden Treaty inference is preserved.
- `elpod audit --production --strict --json` can be a CI or release gate.
- Bun-first commands, generated declarations, a CLI, and a package smoke test.

## Status and roadmap

The core composition model, native routing, DI, lifecycle, configuration, health checks, security primitives, observability boundaries, events/jobs boundaries, cache primitives, HTTP client, testing harness, and CLI diagnostics are implemented. Vendor database adapters, durable queues and brokers, distributed cache/rate limiting, OpenTelemetry SDK/exporter setup, identity providers, and deployment hardening remain application-owned or planned.

See [the production boundary](./docs/production-boundary.md) and [the roadmap](./ROADMAP.md). Overview and guides: [elpod.vercel.app](https://elpod.vercel.app/); full in-repo map: [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md).
